My name is George and I am from Ottawa, Ontario. :) I am a recent engineering grad that loves to travel and explore new places. I have a stayed at a number of exquisite and modern Airbnb's in the past, that I decided to join the community with my own listing, right here in the Nation's Capital. 


Born and raised here in Ottawa, I know the city inside and out and will be more than glad to answer any of your questions. I recommend the following attractions for first time visitors in the city:


1.  Visit Parliament Hill 
2. Skate on the Canal Rideau during the winter 
3.  Visit the Museum of Nature and  the Canadian War Museum
4. Take a stroll and stop by for a bite to eat in the Byward Market
5. Visit Gatineau Park


Excited to be able to host you whether you're a new traveller to my Airbnb or a returning guest. :)

During my time there, I  worked in the service industry, then got into construction before finally settling in the real estate business. My parents are both from Argentina and Chile hence why I speak Spanish fluently and travelled many times to Brazil were I picked up Portuguese because of its similarities to French and Spanish. I love to travel and when I do, I almost always stay in Airbnb's . I find it to be the best way to discover a city, country or continent.

It was first established as a township in 1792, which included the central region of Ottawa. However, in 1978, Nepean Township was recognised as a city. Nepean is geographically bordered by the Ottawa River in the north, Robertson Road to the south, the Rideau River in the east, and Herzberg to the north. Nepean had its own library organisation, police department, and fire service until its amalgamation in 2001. Before its inclusion in Ottawa, education here was governed by the Carleton Board of Education. Still, since its amalgamation, it has joined hands with the Ottawa Board of Education and become the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. The neighbourhood has a diversified community with couples, children, singles, and older people and comprises over 180,000 residents.
