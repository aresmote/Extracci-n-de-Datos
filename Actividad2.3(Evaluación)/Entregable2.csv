I enjoy meeting new people, and for me, welcoming guests to my home often feels like travelling without leaving the house.

I am an industrial designer by training, but I have specialized in exhibit and environmental graphic design. Most of my work is with the national museums in Ottawa and with the National Capital Commission. I have lived in Ottawa for over three decades and have acquired a fondness for Ottawa's history and culture and try my best to pass on its stories and traditions.

Hi! I'm Valerie, and have been living in Ottawa for most of my life. My professional background is international development with a focus on finance and project management. I have toured the world - 200 cities in 61 countries - and I love to explore, travel, eat, cook and read.  My very first trip was to Haiti and my latest expedition was a fabulous  South African safari.  I am also a Personal Travel Designer and I love both five star journeys and budget backpacking.

Giving back to the community is important to me and our business is a ""Champion of Hope"" financial donor for a local men's shelter in Ottawa, Ontario. 

Hi! I'm Valerie, and have been living in Ottawa for most of my life. My professional background is international development with a focus on finance and project management. I have toured the world - 200 cities in 61 countries - and I love to explore, travel, eat, cook and read.  My very first trip was to Haiti and my latest expedition was a fabulous  South African safari.  I am also a Personal Travel Designer and I love both five star journeys and budget backpacking.  My favourite poem is Invictus,  and I would describe myself as lucky, blessed, happy, a foodie, an early adopter, endlessly curious,  the wife of Greg and the mother of two fabulous daughters - who are global citizens.  

We feel very fortunate to be able to host so many wonderful guests in Ottawa. 

Cheers and hope to see you soon!

Glad you cruised by...

I live a life full of adventure, purpose, and laughs. 

I have enjoyed a diverse and eclectic career which has led me to where I am now...with the Ottawa Fire Department as my ""day"" job, CEO of a clean technology company as my passion job, and a stand up comic and Stadium MC/ Host for the Ottawa Redblacks CFL team as my part time jobs...and of course, being a Superhost to a unique AirBnB at my residence in Ottawa. 

While globetrotting over the past twenty years I discovered what works at an Airbnb and have curated my own space to be clean, comfortable, and convenient for my guests. My Airbnb meets the highest standards... my own. 

As a life long Ottawan I know the city like no one else. As a younger man I was the doorman at the Chateau Laurier (Ottawa's most iconic, historic hotel) where I learned the importance of guest service while attending to a VIP clientele of Canadian and international public figures. 

I am bilingual in French and English.

I have traveled the world performing stand up comedy.

I have worked with children affected by HIV.

I am, by virtue of cultural and familial upbringing, polite and considerate.

I am a huge proponent of the circular economy and offer a low-waste space at my BnB.

I am sure I will enjoy meeting you if you have read this far and are still reading.

I never order food without checking with the locals for their faves and I rarely eat at chain food restaurants when there's a better local option. I would rather meet local people and get a sense of their community. I love to cook and with three kids & a husband to feed that's a good combination because boy, can they eat! Best vacations are family vacations. My teenagers still love to travel with us. I guess that says something about our travel adventures, and its a good thing! :) When we travel we make stops to see local curiosities and historic landmarks, often unplanned, screeching halt roadside and we pile out to check out a interesting relic or historic plaque/scene. I tidy a hotel room before I leave as if I was heading out of my own home and I tip the hotel staff. We love the theatre, live musical performances, animated kids movies, good local food and finding humour even in the worst of situations.
I love to meet new people and get to know them when I'm hosting, and I also respect their privacy or preference to be alone. I'm attentive to the guest's needs and like to accommodate as much as possible the guest's special requests.
My motto is do it now because someday I'll be sleeping the sleep of forever and I don't want to miss anything while I'm still here!",,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fc9c81a9-bbcf-4d1b-8c16-bb19713611c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fc9c81a9-bbcf-4d1b-8c16-bb19713611c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,2,2,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Cumberland,,45.49366,-75.46803,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,1.0,1 shared bath,1.0,1.0,"[""TV"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Oven"", ""Host greets you"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Free street parking"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Wifi"", ""Heating"", ""Breakfast"", ""Essentials"", ""Private entrance"", ""Private living room"", ""Bed linens"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shampoo"", ""Hangers"", ""Beach essentials"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Kitchen"", ""Stove"", ""Iron"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Microwave"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Cooking basics"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hot water"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Smoke alarm""]",$78.00,30,30,30,30,30,30,30.0,30.0,,t,29,59,89,89,2024-09-15,2,0,0,2019-06-24,2019-07-01,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,,f,1,0,1,0,0.03

1.  Visit Parliament Hill 
2. Skate on the Canal Rideau during the winter 
3.  Visit the Museum of Nature and  the Canadian War Museum
4. Take a stroll and stop by for a bite to eat in the Byward Market

It was first established as a township in 1792, which included the central region of Ottawa. However, in 1978, Nepean Township was recognised as a city. Nepean is geographically bordered by the Ottawa River in the north, Robertson Road to the south, the Rideau River in the east, and Herzberg to the north. Nepean had its own library organisation, police department, and fire service until its amalgamation in 2001. Before its inclusion in Ottawa, education here was governed by the Carleton Board of Education. Still, since its amalgamation, it has joined hands with the Ottawa Board of Education and become the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. The neighbourhood has a diversified community with couples, children, singles, and older people and comprises over 180,000 residents. Nepean has been home to big-ticket industries like Nortel Networks and JDS Uniphase.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-1140157165585010248/original/173a1e79-baf1-4b24-8ff3-ff45d186da99.jpeg,66864844,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/66864844,Aakash,2016-04-12,,,within an hour,100%,86%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fe6fc422-f3e1-432a-a0f1-996d37db522c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fe6fc422-f3e1-432a-a0f1-996d37db522c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,16,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Rideau-Goulbourn,,45.23515,-75.73178,Entire home,Entire home/apt,16,3.5,3.5 baths,4.0,6.0,"[""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Stainless steel oven"", ""Toaster"", ""Private backyard \u2013 Not fully fenced"", ""TV"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Self check-in"", ""Smart lock"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Dining table"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Washer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Wifi"", ""Paid parking garage off premises"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Body soap"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Shower gel"", ""Essentials"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In unit"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Private entrance"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Bed linens"", ""Bathtub"", ""Shampoo"", ""Hangers"", ""Pool table"", ""Freezer"", ""Arcade games"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Kitchen"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Stove"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker: drip coffee maker"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Microwave"", ""Blender"", ""Coffee"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, and dresser"", ""Hot water"", ""Central heating"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Smoke alarm""]",$150.00,30,1125,30,30,1125,1125,30.0,1125.0,,t,17,38,38,38,2024-09-15,5,5,1,2024-04-28,2024-08-26,3.8,4.0,3.8,4.8,3.6,4.6,3.4,STR-828-919,f,1,1,0,0,1.06
